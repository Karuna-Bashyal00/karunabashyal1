            <p>The Trade Preferences Program came into effect on December 15, 2016 following the introduction of the US Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (H.R.1907). The Act was introduced to support Nepal’s economic recovery in the aftermath of devastating 2015 earthquakes.

            <p>Under this program, initially 66 items, and later on 77 Nepali products (https://us.nepalembassy.gov.np/eligible-77-items-for-duty-free-through-31-dec-2025/) are granted duty-free entry into the US till December 31, 2025. This means goods like carpets and rugs, shawls, scarves, luggage articles, handbags, pocket goods, such as wallets, travel bags and other containers, headbands, blankets, hats and gloves, which previously used to be subject to tariffs ranging from 5 percent to over 20 percent can now enter the US market at zero tariff with quota free. However, such goods must be grown, produced, or manufactured in Nepal, with the cost of the Nepali materials plus the cost of processing at least 35 percent of the product’s sales price.
